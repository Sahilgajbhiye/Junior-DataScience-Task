📊 Insights and Trading Strategy Recommendations
🧠 Introduction
In this analysis, I explored the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment (via the Fear & Greed Index) and actual trader performance using historical data from Hyperliquid. The main goal was to find patterns and extract insights that could help inform smarter, more data-driven trading decisions.

🔍 Key Findings from the Analysis
1. Market Sentiment & Trader Behavior
Looking at the sentiment data, most days were classified as Fear, followed by Greed, Extreme Greed, Neutral, and Extreme Fear. This means the market was generally cautious, with traders navigating uncertainty more often than euphoria.

On the trading side, BUY and SELL orders were fairly balanced overall. But SELL orders had a slight edge, which suggests a lean towards bearish activity during the analyzed period.

2. Correlation Between Sentiment & Closed PnL
I ran a correlation test between the Fear/Greed Index and Closed PnL. The result? A very weak positive correlation (0.01). In simple terms, PnL tends to rise slightly as sentiment moves from fear toward greed — but the effect is minimal. So, sentiment alone doesn’t predict profit reliably.

3. Total PnL by Sentiment Type
Here’s where it gets interesting. Total PnL was highest during Fear periods — over 3.35 million USD, followed by Extreme Greed and Greed. On the other hand, Extreme Fear days saw the lowest total PnL.
This suggests that while the market is fearful, there might be more volatility — and more opportunities for skilled traders to profit.

4. Average Trade Size by Sentiment
When looking at how big the trades were, the largest average trade size occurred during Fear (over $7,800), while the smallest was during Extreme Greed (just above $3,100).
It could mean that confident traders go in heavier when others are cautious — a typical contrarian approach.

5. Daily PnL Trends
The daily PnL trends (based on the chart I plotted) showed ups and downs across all sentiment types. There’s no clear, consistent pattern, but you can spot occasional spikes — proving that short-term opportunities exist no matter the mood of the market.

6. PnL Spread by Sentiment (Box Plot)
The PnL box plot showed something key: most traders hover around break-even, regardless of sentiment. But outliers — both big wins and big losses — exist in all categories. This reinforces the idea that individual strategy and execution matter more than overall sentiment.

💡 Trading Strategy Recommendations
1. Use Fear to Your Advantage
Since PnL and trade size were highest during Fear periods, that’s where opportunities lie. Traders might consider going long on strong assets that are temporarily undervalued. Of course, careful analysis is a must to avoid falling into traps.

2. Be Cautious in Extreme Conditions
Both Extreme Fear and Extreme Greed showed poor performance. These periods seem to be more unpredictable and may not favor even experienced traders. During such times, it’s wise to either reduce exposure or stick to tight risk controls.

3. Rely on Strategy, Not Just Sentiment
The data makes it clear: sentiment alone won’t make you profitable. It’s just one tool. A solid trading plan, strong risk management, and technical/fundamental analysis should always guide your decisions.

4. Use Sentiment as Confirmation, Not a Signal
Instead of trading because of sentiment, use it as extra confirmation. For example, if you see a bullish technical setup during a Fear day, that could boost your confidence. But don’t trade purely based on what the sentiment says.

5. Adjust Trade Sizes Based on Market Mood
Trade sizes tend to be larger during Fear and smaller during Extreme Greed. That might be worth factoring into your own position sizing — go bigger when risk/reward is favorable (and volatility is high), and reduce size when the market feels overextended.

✅ Final Thoughts
The Fear & Greed Index is a great tool for understanding market psychology, but it’s not a magic formula for profits. However, combining sentiment with PnL patterns, trade sizes, and daily trends does reveal interesting opportunities — especially during Fear periods.

At the end of the day, it’s not just about reading the market. It’s about having a plan, managing risk, and staying disciplined no matter what the sentiment says.
